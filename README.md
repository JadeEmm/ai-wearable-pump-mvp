# AI-Enabled Wearable Breast Pump MVP

## **Overview**

This project is a proof-of-concept (PoC) for an AI-integrated wearable breast pump system. The solution combines cutting-edge machine learning, generative AI, and a user-friendly dashboard to deliver actionable insights to breastfeeding mothers. It provides real-time metrics, personalized dietary recommendations, and a detailed nutrient quality analysis of breast milk.

## **Key Features**
1. **Real-Time Metrics**:
   - Tracks suction pressure, milk flow rate, and comfort levels.
   - Optimizes pumping sessions dynamically.

2. **Nutrient Quality Analysis**:
   - Analyzes milk composition (fat, protein, vitamins).
   - Identifies potential deficiencies.

3. **Dietary Suggestions**:
   - Recommends food sources tailored to deficiencies and dietary preferences.
   - Accounts for allergies and lifestyle choices (e.g., vegan).

4. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Displays session summaries, insights, and personalized reports.
   - Enables sharing detailed reports with healthcare professionals.

5. **AI-Powered Learning**:
   - Continuously learns user preferences and adjusts settings.
   - Provides long-term trends and recommendations.

### **Architecture Description**
1. **Data Simulation**:
   - Simulates milk flow, nutrient levels, and comfort data for the MVP.
   - Generates synthetic datasets to mimic real-world hardware input.

2. **AI and ML Models**:
   - Machine Learning for real-time suction adjustment (Reinforcement Learning).
   - Generative AI for dietary recommendations and personalized insights.

3. **Frontend Dashboard**:
   - Built with React.js.
   - Displays real-time metrics and insights in an intuitive interface.

4. **Backend APIs**:
   - Python Flask APIs handle communication between the AI models and the dashboard.
   - Processes input data and outputs recommendations.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Hosted on free cloud services (e.g., Google Colab, Render, or Hugging Face Spaces).
